Overall:
	Handling of ghost orbitals.

SetupRuns.py:
	All the bits concerning Inelastica need to be rewritten

EigenChannels:
	Re-establish the calculation of FGR scattering rates

Inelastica:
	Rates saved to file for faster calculation?
	Units for the extDamp parameter?

pyTBT:
	?

Phonons:
	Phonon bandstruct: With symmetry operations it is difficult to 
	move the compare the start vector with the vector after the symmetry
	operation since we might have to move it with a periodic unit ...
	Now this is solved by reducing the range/radie to 0.8 of the possible
	radie making the program inefficient.

SCBA routines:
	Migrate to numpy?
	pyMPI?

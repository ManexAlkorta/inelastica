# Inelastica #
__Inelastica__ is a Python package for the SIESTA/TranSIESTA DFT codes
as well as a script to compute inelastic transport, while _inelastica_ is the repository name.

## Features ##
Inelastica contains a number of scripts such as

    `geom2geom`: Geometry conversion between different file formats
    `Bandstructures`: Computation of electron and phonon band structures
    `pyTBT`: A Python version of tbtrans for elastic electron transport
    `EigenChannels`: Eigenchannel analysis and generation of real-space scattering state wave functions
    `Phonons`: Vibration modes/frequencies and electron-vibration couplings
    `Inelastica': Inelastic transport (IETS)

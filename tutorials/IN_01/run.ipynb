    "* Construct a setup with 2D or 3D Cu electrodes. Now, in principle a sampling of the (transverse) Brillouin zone is required (just for the electronic part, assuming we can still restrict CO vibrations to the Gamma point, ie. decoupled molecues). This can be achieved through (1) carrying out a loop over a `k`-points to compute EPCs and associated k-resolved IETS, before (2) performing the BZ average (see Inelastica script `kaverage-IETS`).  "

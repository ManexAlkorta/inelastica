Installing python packages are usually easy. 
1: If you can install as superuser is is as easy as:
a)   python setup.py install

2: If you cannot install as superuser:
a)   python setup.py install --prefix=/home/yourUser/local/python-packages
b)   set PYTHONPATH to /home/yourUser/local/python-packages/lib/python2.6/site-packages/
   Remember to include this in your .bashrc (export PYTHONPATH=/home/...) or
   your .tcshrc (setenv PYTHONPATH /home/...)

3: Inelastica requires a few additional packages that may not be installed on your machine. The install will tell you if that is the case.

4: Good luck and remember that documentation is mainly at the wiki.

# Common problems

1: Complaints about fortran:

    python setup.py build --help-fcompiler

tells you what fortran compilers are avalable. My recomendation is ifort:

    rm -fr build
    python setup.py build --fcompiler=intelem [or intel for 32bit]
    python setup.py install

Unfortunately numpy has a bug preventing 
    "python setup.py install --fcompiler=..."
Build first with "--fcompiler=..." then install.
